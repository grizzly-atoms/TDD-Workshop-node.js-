# Pitfalls

As with most disciplines, TDD can be applied in a way that will actually impede your goals. Remember, the reason we are using TDD is to increase our confidence that we haven't broken anything so we can refactor often, keeping our code clean and easy to understand so that ultimate we are able to move fast all the time. Here are some pitfalls that will keep this from happening, even though you might be test driving your code:

## Outside In BDD misapplied
## Mocking is misapplied (mock all the things!!!)
## Unit testing is misapplied

"Every class should be paired with a well-designed unit test" - FALSE
