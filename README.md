# TDD Workshop (node.js)

This workshop includes an overview of Test Driven Development as well as a series of excercises to build up some TDD skils. It is a supplement to a presentation I gave to coworkers. In creating this content I drew heavily from a number of bloggers. [See resources](content/05-resources.md).
